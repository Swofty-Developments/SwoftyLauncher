// AI line set guard (re/db/functions.tsv Sess_Build_AiSystem, F1_25.exe+0x5ff750).
//
// Sess_Build_AiSystem builds one 0x508-byte AI record per vehicle slot, in the vector at [builder + 0xa8]. Six pointers
// in the record (+0x58 the racing line cache, +0x60, +0x68, +0x70, +0x78, +0x80 the lookup tables the per-car AI update
// feeds) come from six hash maps keyed by the hash of the car's profile name; a name no map lists stores 0, with no
// check. Ai_Job_UpdateCarsParallel (0x14063e370) hands those pointers to Ai_LineCache_UpdateIfChanged (0x140686a40) and
// the table cursor updates for every car on every tick, and the first of them reads [pointer + 0x178]: a car whose name
// the maps do not list faults reading 0x178 about 20 ms after the session starts. A third car in a team (My Team,
// garages with three cars) is such a car: the same name hash that the session enter guard finds in no AI asset group.
//
// site_Ai_BuildSystem_RecordPushed is the join after the record was appended (inc bpl, builder in rbx, both the in
// place and the regrown path land here). The last record is [rbx + 0xb0] - 0x508. For each of its six pointers that is
// 0, the guard copies the pointer of the earliest other record that has one, so the car races on that car's line and
// tables instead of faulting. Records pushed before any record has pointers (the first cars of a session) are backfilled
// the same way on the push that supplies the first donor; with no donor in the vector nothing is written. +0x78 is the one table the update checks for 0 itself, so it is borrowed only when +0x58 was
// empty too (a name no map lists); a listed car's empty +0x78 stays empty. The pointers are shared, read only objects the maps own, and every car keeps its own cursors in
// its record. A record with all six pointers runs the game's code unchanged.
//
// SWOFTY_AI_LINE_SET_GUARD=0 turns it off.
