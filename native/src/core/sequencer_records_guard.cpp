// Career events sequencer record guard (re/db/globals.tsv site_Game_CareerEventsSequencerFirstRecord).
//
// Game_CareerEventsSequencer_Initialise (0x140c71e80) runs as a career session is entered. After the career hub scenes
// it adds the team mate asset groups: it looks the session's event up in the career event table (CareerEventData +0x2e8
// .. +0x2f0, records of 0x88 bytes), then collects every record of the table with the same +0x58 and +0x5a bytes as that
// record and the game's equality (0x1424ceb70 fills a pointer vector at [rsp+0x98], begin at [rsp+0xa0]), and reads the
// first collected record (mov rdx,[rax] at 0x140c72ea0). An event not in the table never gets here (the lookup jumps
// past this block at 0x140c72d51/0x140c72d61). The collection skips records whose +0x5e is 0x3fff and keeps only those
// the equality accepts, so an event whose own record is one of those, or fails the equality, collects nothing: begin is 0
// and the read faults with ACCESS_VIOLATION reading 0x0 at F1_25.exe+0xc72ea0 as the first session of the career is entered (a 2014 and a 2016
// Progressive Career with a third-party calendar package).
//
// The cleanup after the asset group call already tests the vector's begin for 0 (test rdx,rdx / je 0x140c72ee2). At the
// site a null rax resumes at that join (site_Game_CareerEventsSequencerRecordsJoin) with the asset groups of that event
// left out, which only costs the team mate scene assets. Nothing the skipped calls produce is read after the join.
//
// Team mate driver guard (site_Game_CareerEventsSequencerTeamMateDriver). The same block then looks the first collected
// record's driver up in the entrants system: Ent_Get_Driver_Thunk (0x1423dbcf0, rcx = r13 = the entrants system) takes
// the record's packed driver ref at +0x50 (domain byte, u16 stat id at +0x52) and returns the driver record, or 0 when
// the domain is above 2, the domain has no driver table, or the id is past the table's end or names an empty slot. The
// game passes that to Game_CareerEventResourceManager_AddDriverMorphData unchecked, which reads [driver+8] at +0x82 and
// faults reading 0x8 as the session is entered, at every load of a My Team or Progressive career whose team mate's
// driver the entrants system does not have.
//
// At the site (mov r8,rax before that call) a null rax resumes at the call's return
// (site_Game_CareerEventsSequencerTeamMateDriverJoin), where the collected vector is freed as usual. AddDriverMorphData
// itself does nothing for a driver whose head it does not find, so the skip only leaves out the team mate's driver
// morph assets. The team mate's domain and stat id are logged once.
//
// Player driver guard (site_Game_CareerEventsSequencerPlayerDriver). Further on the function finds the player's own
// entrant in the game module's entrant list (Sess_Match_EntrantIdentity_Thunk against a human key with the signed-in
// user's id block), looks its driver up the same way (0x140c73104, rcx = r15 = the entrants system, rdx = r12 = the
// entrant + 0x50) and passes the result to AddDriverMorphData unchecked again. At the mov r8,rax before that call a
// null rax resumes at the call's return (site_Game_CareerEventsSequencerPlayerDriverJoin), which is also where the
// function goes when it finds no player entrant. The player's domain and stat id are logged once.
//
// All six sites are exported by the bindings (L2 with an agree verify). SWOFTY_SEQUENCER_RECORDS_GUARD=0 turns all
// three off.
