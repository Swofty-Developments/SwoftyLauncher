// Garage crew guard (re/db/globals.tsv site_Game_GarageCrew_SpawnVector).
//
// Game_GarageCrewModule_SpawnGarageCrew collects the session's assignment records for one garage into a vector of
// 16-byte entries {record, slot}, then creates one crew instance per entry and stores it at [rsp + index*8 + 0x290]
// with no bound. The array holds the two cars a garage has; the slot after it holds the vector's own pointer, which
// the epilogue frees through GAME_DEFAULT. A team that fields a third car puts a third record (slot 2) in its garage,
// the third crew pointer overwrites the vector pointer, and the free fails with "Invalid address for this heap" as the
// session loads. Sess_Set_GarageSlotEntrant already ignores slot >= 2, so only the crew spawn trips over it.
//
// At the site (rcx = vector begin, r13 = vector end, ebp = garage id) the guard keeps the first two entries whose slot
// is below 2 and lowers r13 over the rest. The extra car still races; its garage crew is not spawned.
//
// The crew instance of a garage is built from the team's crew template, found through the session's team tables
// ([[module + 0x48] + 0x2c8 + kind * 0x10], row team * 0x10 + 8, the record's kind at +0x58 and team at +0x5a); the
// function reads [template + 0x560] with no null test, so a car whose team has no template faults the session load
// at SpawnGarageCrew+0xce0. The guard drops those entries from the vector as well; the module is at [rsp + 0xc0].
//
// The pit stops module sets its crews up from fn 0x1403c69e0, which walks the 32 garages and, for each, scans the
// garage's entry vector ([rsp + 0xa8]) for the first entry with a team crew template (the same chain as above); rdi is
// that template or 0. It is passed to Game_PitStops_SetupCrew as the fifth argument, which reads [template + 0x560]
// at +0x12fb with no null test. A garage whose entries have no template (an empty garage, or a team the session has
// no crew template for) faults the session load there ("reading 0x560"). At site_Game_PitStops_CrewTemplateRead the
// guard sends such a garage to site_Game_PitStops_CrewTemplateSkip, which frees the entry vector and moves on to the
// next garage; the garage gets no pit stops crew and its cars still race.
//
// SWOFTY_GARAGE_CREW_GUARD=0 turns it off.
