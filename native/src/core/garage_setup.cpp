// Garage setup list guard (re/db/functions.tsv Game_GarageSetups_FindOwnerName, F1_25.exe+0xc22c47).
//
// Opening the garage (and loading a setup in My Team practice) rebuilds the setup list: FUN_140c20280 walks the saved
// setups (0x218 bytes each at [list + 0x308]) and FUN_140c21600 fills one row. For a setup whose owner id (+0xa0) is not
// -1 the row calls FUN_140c22ad0(list, id), which walks the flat hash set at [list + 0x340] (entries at +0x58, control
// words at +0x60, one control byte per 8 bits of the tzcnt) for the entry whose [[[entry + 0x38] + 0x260] + 0x2a8]
// equals the id, then formats the name at +0x220 into a registry node path. The walk has no end test: it assumes the id
// is in the set. When no entry carries the id, because the setup was saved for a car or team the current grid no
// longer has, the walk reaches the set's end marker, takes the entry slot past the end array as an entry and faults
// reading [entry + 0x38] with a non-canonical entry (r9 = 0x2a00002f33000020 in every report, "reading
// 0xffffffffffffffff").
//
// site_Game_GarageSetups_EntryStep is the lea that follows the entry load in the walk's loop. When the entry in r9 is
// not a readable chain down to the id, the guard continues at site_Game_GarageSetups_NotFound, the function's own
// not-found exit, which returns a null name; the row is built with an empty owner name, as it is when the registry
// node is missing. An entry that reads through runs the game's code unchanged.
//
// SWOFTY_GARAGE_SETUP_GUARD=0 turns it off.
