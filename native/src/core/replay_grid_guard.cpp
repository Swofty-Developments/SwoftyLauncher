// Replay recorder holder guard (re/db/globals.tsv site_Ne_ReplayAfterRecord).
//
// Ne_Replay_WriteFrames walks one registry entry per recordable (stride 0x688). Each entry has a state holder, a heap
// block of a 0x80 byte header and a current and a previous buffer, whose class (capacity 0x20 to 0xffff) was picked at
// registration from the state a stock grid needs. Each frame the recordable serializes into a static scratch buffer
// through a stack stream, and the recorder copies that state into the holder's current buffer with the state's full
// size and no check against the holder. A recordable whose state grows with the session's vehicle count (a career
// addon that adds rows to the grid, 25 vehicles on a 22 car plan) outgrows its holder, and the copy writes past the
// block into the next heap block. The next walk calls the vtable of a holder that block overwrote: ACCESS_VIOLATION in
// Ne_Replay_WriteFrames+0x752, at the call of that holder's capacity method.
//
// At site_Ne_ReplayAfterRecord, after the recordable serialized and before either copy, the stream position is
// [rsp+0x98], its base [rsp+0xa0] and the holder's capacity [rsp+0x108]. A state larger than the capacity is cut to
// nothing by moving the position back to the base: the recorder then writes an empty state for that recordable and
// copies no bytes into the holder. The session's grid is not touched. A state that fits runs the game's code unchanged.
// The first skip is logged.
//
// SWOFTY_REPLAY_GRID_GUARD=0 turns it off.
