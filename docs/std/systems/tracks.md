description: Tracks in code - tracks, venues, per-season track data, the track list each Grand Prix and Time Trial box offers, world layers, slots and AI lines as typed registries, with imported tracks and the track events and operations.
---

# Tracks

Add a track to the game, give it lap counts, fuel and tyres for each season, and decide which Grand Prix and Time Trial boxes offer it. Hockenheim, for example, is one `tracks::Track` record: it starts from a copy of Austria, provides the real circuit `venue/hockenheimring`, and shows up in every box it fits.

A few terms used on this page:

- A **track** is a `tracks::Track` record: the track's files, its database rows and its names.
- A **venue** is a real circuit, with an id under `venue/` that the core owns. Calendars name venues, not tracks. A track **provides** one or more venues.
- A **data set** is one of the game's sets of track data, such as `f1_2026` or `sprint_f1_2026`. Every track has a `tracks::TrackData` block in each set: laps, fuel, tyres, pit lane, names and the weekend's date.
- A **box** is one of the year tiles a player picks in Grand Prix or Time Trial. In code it's a [content package](/std/content).
- The **base** is the data every year shares. A track an addon adds goes into the base.

::: warning Experimental in 1.6.5
The four tracks registries, `tracks::tracks` (`track`), `tracks::venues` (`track.venue`), `tracks::data` (`track.data`) and `tracks::per_package` (`track.per_package`), are experimental: each one's `status.json` is `{ "status": "experimental", "since": "1.6.5", "feature": "registry_tracks" }`, and their shapes can change before they are stable (see [Status](/std/versioning#status)).
:::

What 1.6.5 ships:

- **The four registries,** in code and in data files, with their schemas in `packages/sdk/std/registries/`.
- **The stock tracks as records.** Every `tracks.Track` row with assets is `game/<code>` with `time_trial` true, each real circuit is `venue/<key>`, and each stock data block is `game/<code>/<data set>`.
- **Tracks made for 1.5** (`track.add` in `ops/`) as records `<addon id>/<code>`. The launcher keeps adding their rows and files, and reports them to the core.
- **A track record** (`registry/track.json`, or `tracks::tracks.add`): the core adds its rows at boot, and the launcher places its files.
- **Each box's track list** in the log and in `catalog.json`, and a guard on the track select screen that stops a track the box can't run.
- **The venues table,** `packages/sdk/std/data/venues.json`: the 39 venues the core seeds, with the names a track made for 1.5 is matched against.
- **Real calendars in Classic Seasons:** each season from 2016 to 2024 registers its calendar as `career.calendar` `f1_<year>`, and its package names it.
- **An example addon,** `templates/std/track`: Hockenheim as a track record, in data files and in code, with its tests.
- **From 1.6.0:** `set_track_fuel`, `copy_track_fuel`, `restore_track_fuel`, `tracks::Fuel` and `session.fuel.load` (`tracks::events::FuelLoad`).

Not in 1.6.5; their sections describe the design:

- `track.layer`, `track.slots` and `track.ai_line`. `PackageTrack::world` is stored and not applied.
- The `track.data.get` point, `tracks::set_data` and `tracks::track_list`. The core uses its own track list and data writer.
- The `ui.track_select.build` point, a career racing each season's real calendar, and Time Trial on added tracks.

</template>
</Example>

The records and their ids:

- **`track`:** stock rows are `game/<code>`. A dormant stock row (one without assets, such as `game/sochi`) is a record a `slot` can name, and is offered nowhere. A track made for 1.5 is `<addon id>/<code>`, listed by each build in `$DATA/registry/older-tracks.json`; it fills the stock row `game/<code>` when the game ships a row with its code (`mod.sochi` fills `game/sochi`).
- **`track.venue`:** `venue/<key>` ids, seeded by the core. A track lists the venues it provides in `provides`; the venue's `track` is the last enabled provider in load order. A stock track provides its real circuit (`game/melbourne` provides `venue/albert_park`). Reverse layouts and dormant rows provide nothing.
- **`track.data`:** `<track id>/<data set>`. The core seeds `game/<code>/<data set>` for every stock block. An added track's blocks are variants of its base's, so a layer on `game/austria/f1_2026` reaches `mod.hockenheim/hockenheim/f1_2026` until it sets that field itself.
- **`track.per_package`:** `<package id>/<key>`, applied while that box is picked and put back when it's left.

`track.data` applies at boot in 1.6.5: the core writes each block's registered values into the database before it loads. At session load it writes fuel again into the data set the session reads. A layer added after boot on another field is logged as taking effect at the next start.

## The venues

The core seeds one `track.venue` record per entry of `packages/sdk/std/data/venues.json`: the 32 circuits of the 2016 to 2025 calendars by their Jolpica ids, `madrid`, the dormant stock `hanoi`, and the real circuits of community tracks (`okayama`, `buddh`, `valencia`, `autopolis`, `igora_drive`).

```json
// packages/sdk/std/data/venues.json
{ "version": 1, "venues": {
  "albert_park":    { "name": "Albert Park Circuit", "country": "australia", "aliases": ["Albert Park", "Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit", "Melbourne"], "stock": "melbourne" },
  "hockenheimring": { "name": "Hockenheimring", "country": "germany", "aliases": ["Hockenheim", "Hockenheimring Baden-Wurttemberg"], "stock": null },
  "sepang":         { "name": "Sepang International Circuit", "country": "malaysia", "aliases": ["Sepang", "Kuala Lumpur", "Malaysia"], "stock": null }
} }
```

- **`stock`** is the stock track with assets that provides the venue: `game/melbourne` provides `venue/albert_park`. Each of the 25 stock tracks with assets provides one venue. Reverse layouts and dormant rows provide none.
- **`name` and `aliases`** are what a track made for 1.5 is matched against, never its code. Both sides are lower-cased and every run of other characters becomes one space, so `Sepang` matches `venue/sepang` and `Portimao` matches `venue/portimao`. No match, or a match on two venues, leaves the track without a venue.
- **A venue not in the table** can't be named: `venue/` ids belong to the core. A new real circuit is a new entry in this file.

## Hockenheim, in code

<Split>

Hockenheim is a new track, not a stock slot. It clones Austria's rows in every data set and provides `venue/hockenheimring`.

- **Every data set gets a block,** cloned from Austria's as a variant. A variant is a record that inherits another record's values and overrides some of them. A layer, a change to an existing record, on Austria's data reaches Hockenheim until Hockenheim sets that field itself.
- **A selector** layers every record that matches, here every one of Hockenheim's data blocks. An edit on one set changes that set only.
- **The core allocates the stat id,** the number the game's database uses for the row. It comes from the install's stat-id store and stays the same at every later start.
- **The world** keeps the stock counts: `hockenheim_f1_26` has 22 grid slots and 11 garages, and the My Team world has 24 and 12.
- **Time Trial is off.** `time_trial` stays `false` for an added track. Time Trial on added tracks crashes or freezes, and the cause needs reverse engineering.
- **It ships as an example** in `templates/std/track`. The data files are the addon, `native/src/track.cpp` is the same records in code, and `track/standin.sh` copies in an archive of your own, since no track art ships. Its tests run both forms and check that they give the same track, venue and data blocks.

## A calendar that uses it, optionally

<Split>

Classic Seasons 2016 races the 2016 calendar. Round 12 is the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, which only a track addon provides.

- **A round names a venue.** It resolves live to the last enabled track in load order that provides the venue, the same way every other contest between addons is decided (see [Shared ids](/std/providers#shared-ids)).
- **A venue a stock track provides is required.** Albert Park is always there.
- **`.optional()`** (`?` in a data file) drops the round while no enabled track provides the venue. Sochi, Hockenheim and Sepang are optional in 2016.
- **`.or_else(...)`** (`a|b`) names a stand-in instead. Classic Seasons names none, so a round with no track is dropped, not raced elsewhere.
- **The package names its calendar** with `content::Package::calendar`, optionally, so a calendar that doesn't resolve leaves the box as it was.

Every Classic Seasons season from 2016 to 2024 registers its calendar this way, made by `addons/classicseasons/classic-seasons/tools/calendars.py` from Progressive's `data/rounds.json`: each race of the year in round order, with its name and date. The optional rounds, those at venues no stock track provides:

```text
2016  venue/sochi, venue/hockenheimring, venue/sepang
2017  venue/sochi, venue/sepang
2018  venue/ricard, venue/hockenheimring, venue/sochi
2019  venue/ricard, venue/hockenheimring, venue/sochi
2020  venue/mugello, venue/sochi, venue/nurburgring, venue/portimao, venue/istanbul
2021  venue/portimao, venue/ricard, venue/sochi, venue/istanbul
2022  venue/ricard
2023  none
2024  none
```

The same calendar serves boxes and careers:

- **A box** shows it first in its track list (see the next section).
- **A career** keeps its own calendar in 1.6.5. In the design, a career can race each season's real calendar. The career wizard offers the choice, and new careers default to real calendars. The core rebuilds the calendar at each season break from that season's calendar (`career::Season::calendar`), and drops a round whose venue no enabled track provides.

A [guard](/std/dependencies) stops a saved career whose track has gone missing.

## The tracks a box offers

<Split>

Every track in the base is offered in every box where it fits. The track select screen shows the box's season first, then the rest:

1. **The season's real calendar,** in round order. The box names its calendar with `content::Package::calendar`. A round whose venue no enabled track provides is dropped.
2. **"More tracks":** every other track in the base that fits, in the base order. A track an addon adds next month appears here without the box knowing about it.

A track that doesn't fit is left out of that box, with the reason in the log. A track fits a box when all five of these hold:

- **World.** The track's files hold the world the box's setup mode loads, when other tracks hold it. F1 2012 Season's setup mode `bdx_2012_mode` loads its own `2012` worlds, which it ships for the stock tracks only. A community track such as Mugello is left out of that box.
- **Garages.** The world the box's setup mode loads at that track has a garage for every team in the box. The setup mode is the game's rule set a weekend runs under. Boxes made from a `content::Package` share `swofty_f1`; an addon's box can bring its own.
- **Grid size.** That world, with any extra slots from `tracks::slots`, has a grid slot for every car the box runs. Grid size is one boot setting per install, and each box is clamped to it.
- **AI data.** Every car in the box has AI data at the track: an AI line for its `ai_package_folder/asset_filename`, and the track's `ai_track_difficulties` entry for its package.
- **Time Trial support.** In a Time Trial box, the track is a stock track, a track made for 1.5 or a record track with `time_trial` set, and its facts don't say `time_trial: false`.

A box with no `content.package` record, such as an addon's [era box](/std/systems/ui#an-era-box-and-a-team-logo), is read from the database the game reads: the core counts the teams and cars of its entrant list (its `entrant_list_references` included), reads the list's season and takes the setup mode whose entrant setup mode lists it. An addon's own entrant setup mode comes before `swofty_f1`, which holds every era box's list. A stock box with no record keeps unknown teams and cars, and those rules pass.

Each build writes what the rules read to `$DATA/registry/track-facts.json`: the track layers of the database the game reads (the runtime database edits the core applies at its early stage included), and per track code the grid slots, garages and pit boxes of each world after the grid extension, each world read at the path its layer's `worldEri` names, the AI folders, the `ai_track_difficulties` packages, whether Time Trial can run there (`time_trial_why` when not) and, for a track record, the menu lists it has pictures in. A rule with no facts passes and logs `[tracks] <code>: no facts (<what>)`.

[tracks] box game/f1_2026 (time_trial): 26 tracks; left out 4 added tracks (no Time Trial support)
```

A venue a calendar repeats, such as 2020's two races at the Red Bull Ring, is listed once and counted as one round. `$DATA/registry/catalog.json` holds the boxes of the last build that ran, with its profile and build; a box press under another profile or build starts it again. `swofty registry tracks` prints them for the current profile:

```text
as of the last session of profile Classic Seasons (build 9d7a5f9177e1436d):
box swofty.classic-seasons-2016/f1_2016 (grand prix): calendar 20, more tracks 9, left out 1
  calendar: game/melbourne, game/bahrain, game/shanghai, ...
  more tracks: game/melbourne_reverse, mod.okayama/okayama, ...
  left out mod.miami24/igora_drive: its swofty_f1 world has 10 garages; the box has 11 teams
```

The track select screen's list builder needs reverse engineering (`ui.track_select.build`, `ui::events::TrackSelectBuild`). Until it's understood, the screen shows every track in the base in the game's own order. A guard on the screen stops a track that doesn't fit before the session loads:

```text
Igora Drive can't run in F1 2016
  Its garages hold 10 teams. F1 2016 has 11.
  [Back]
```

```text
Mugello can't run in game/bdx_s5_2012
  It has no 2012 world, the one game/bdx_s5_2012 loads.
  [Back]
```

```text

[tracks] guard: mod.mugello/mugello in game/bdx_s5_2012 (grand_prix): refused (its files hold no 2012 world, which the box's bdx_2012_mode layer loads)
```

## A box's own track data

<Split>

A box can also give a track its own data: laps, fuel, tyre class, pit lane, names, date and world version. Each entry is a `tracks::PackageTrack`.

- **Name the venue,** not a track code. The data goes to whichever track the venue resolves to: Hockenheim from any author gets it.
- **An empty field comes from the base track data,** and layers on the base reach every box that doesn't set the field.
- **`offered = false`** leaves a track out of the box. **`order`** places a track under "More tracks".
- **A variant package** (F1 2017 V10) inherits its base package's track data.
- **Any addon can give a box data.** A box's entries are the ids `<package id>/<key>` and every `per_package` record whose `package` names the box.
- **It applies when the box is picked.** The core writes the box's data into the track data the game reads (`Game_TrackData_GetTrack`), and puts it back when the box is left. A Grand Prix box's fuel goes into every data set its setup mode reads when the box is picked, and the session's track again at session load.
- **In 1.6.5 the core writes `fuel`.** `laps`, `pit`, `names`, `date` and `tyre_class` are stored, and apply once those fields of the game's track data are mapped (see [Readiness and limits](#readiness-and-limits)).
- **`fuel.burn_per_lap` is the track's fuel-per-lap figure.** The game uses it for the MFD fuel delta, the fuel strategy and refuelling. The car's real burn comes from its power unit, and the race's starting fuel stays the same.

[tracks] box fuel: 6 of 6 write(s) put back (the box was left)
```

A 5-lap race at Monaco, read from the game's UDP car status (`m_fuelInTank`, `m_fuelRemainingLaps`):

```text
F1 2017 box, burn_per_lap 2.5:  start 9.30 kg, fuel delta -1.34 laps (9.30 / 2.5 - 5), burn 1.06 to 1.09 kg per lap
F1 2016 box, stock 1.18:        start 9.29 kg, fuel delta +2.78 laps (9.29 / 1.18 - 5), burn 1.08 to 1.12 kg per lap
```

- **The fuel delta, strategy and refuelling** read `burn_per_lap`: the MFD's laps of fuel left, the fuel-for-laps the start sequence sets, the garage refuel and the virtual session's per-lap fuel.
- **The car's burn** comes from its power unit: it burns the stock amount whatever `burn_per_lap` says. The fuel delta drifts back as the game measures the real use during the race.
- **The starting fuel** comes from the track's race fuel rows (`Game_CarSetup_SessionFuelLoad`), which `burn_per_lap` doesn't change.

A 2018-only layout addon edits only the 2018 box's entry:

```cpp
tracks::per_package.layer(tracks::per_package["swofty.classic-seasons-2018/f1_2018/hockenheimring"], [](tracks::PackageTrack &t) {
    t.world = tracks::layers["mod.hockenheim-2018/hockenheim_2018"];
});
```

## Imported tracks

<Split>

A track imported from a zip, or made for 1.5, is an addon with `track.add` in `ops/track.json`. A track record, `registry/track.json` or `tracks::tracks.add`, moves its database rows to the core.

1. **Without a track record, `track.add` runs as in 1.5.** The launcher adds the rows, places the files and gives the track the stat id after the highest enabled one. It reports each track to the core, which lists it as `<addon id>/<code>` with `time_trial` false.
2. **The venue comes from the track's name, never its code.** `mod.bahrain24` is Sepang, `mod.hanoi` is Valencia and `mod.miami24` is Igora Drive. The launcher matches the name against the venues' names.
3. **With a track record,** `track.add` places the files only: the archive, mipmaps, asset groups, UI art, the extra grid slots and the AI line fix. The core clones the base track's rows in every data set at boot, routes the track resource to the track's own asset groups, points its `TrackTextures` at the menu pictures the build made (the facts file's `ui_lists`), adds the menu entries and names, takes the stat id from the install's store and provides the venue.
4. **Package fixes happen once, at import:** stand-in worlds, mip paths, passing space on the AI line.
5. **Calendars** that ask for the venue resolve live.

Two addons claiming one stock slot is a provider clash. The second is refused at boot, with both named:

```text
[registry] track mod.igora_d/igora: slot game/miami24 is already filled by mod.miami24/igora_drive; refused
```

Two tracks that provide the same venue both stay in the base. The venue, and every calendar round that names it, goes to the one later in load order.

## Worlds, slots and AI lines

Not in 1.6.5: `track.layer`, `track.slots` and `track.ai_line` have no registry yet. This section is the design.

A bigger grid needs more grid slots, garages and pit boxes than a world has. Custom Grid Size provides them per world. Grid size is one boot setting per install, and the core patches the slots for that size into the world archives at boot:

```cpp
tracks::slots.add("monza_myteam_30", {
    .layer = tracks::layers["game/monza/myteam"],
    .grid = grid_cs::slots("monza", 30), .garages = grid_cs::garages("monza", 30), .pit_boxes = grid_cs::boxes("monza", 30),
});
```

A layer row gives a track a world for one mode:

```cpp
// the classic world for Hockenheim
tracks::layers.add("hockenheim_swofty_f1", {
    .track = tracks::tracks["mod.hockenheim/hockenheim"], .mode = "swofty_f1",
    .world = { "environment_package/tracks/hockenheim", "hockenheim_f1_26" }, .grid = 22, .garages = 11,
});
```

## Track data at run time

Not in 1.6.5: the `track.data.get` point and `tracks::set_data`. This section is the design.

`track.data.get` is a hot hook point: the game calls it from 110 places. Its handlers run once per track when the core builds the point's table (a box picked, a career loaded, a session loaded), and the game's calls read the table.

```cpp
// track.data.get: Progressive copies 2025 fuel into the 2026 track objects for a season
events::on<tracks::events::DataGet>().in(events::owner("swofty.progressive"))
    .after([](tracks::events::DataGet &g, const events::Context &ctx) {
        if (g.data_set == "f1_2026" && ctx.career()->year <= 2025)
            g.data.fuel = progressive::fuel_2025(g.track);
    });

tracks::set_data(tracks::tracks["game/monaco"], [](tracks::TrackData &d) { d.laps = 78; });   // put back on unload
```

```text
[ops] tracks::set_data game/monaco: laps 50 -> 78 (career 3f2a); put back on career.unloaded
```

## Readiness and limits

- **The four registries are experimental** in 1.6.5. Their shapes can change before they are stable.
- **Records:** stock rows, venues, record tracks and tracks made for 1.5 are records at boot. A record track's rows, names and stat id come from the core; the launcher places its files.
- **No tracks registry records, no track made for 1.5:** the core seeds the venues and the stock tracks that provide them (without stat ids), so calendars stay valid, and doesn't read the game database for the base. The base is empty, no box list is built and the guard lets every track through.
- **Calendars:** Classic Seasons 2016 to 2024 name their real calendars. Careers keep their own calendars in 1.6.5.
- **Track data at boot:** `track.data` values are written into the database before it loads, so they hold from the first session. At session load the core writes fuel again into the data set the session reads.
- **A box's own data: fuel.** `per_package` applies `fuel` when the box is picked and puts it back when it's left. The game reads `fuel_burn_per_lap` for the MFD fuel delta, the garage refuel, the virtual session's per-lap fuel and a fuel-for-laps set in the start sequence. The car's real burn comes from its power unit, and a race's starting fuel comes from the track's race fuel rows (`Game_CarSetup_SessionFuelLoad`); a burn per lap changes neither (see [What `burn_per_lap` changes](#what-burn-per-lap-changes)). The reader of the game's track data (`TrackDataTrack`, 0x290 bytes) is mapped at L1: laps at +0xe0 (a pointer to the database value), weekend month and day at +0xf4 and +0xf8, pit speed limit and stop times at +0x21c to +0x224. Fuel at +0xf0 is L2. The other fields apply once their readers are proven.
- **The box's track list: logged, not shown.** The core works out each box's list and writes it to the log and `catalog.json`. The track select screen still shows its own list, built from view-model nodes (`track_data.track_list`, `track_info.gm_track_list`). The list builder behind `ui.track_select.build` isn't found yet.
- **The guard:** the Grand Prix confirm (`advance_pressed`) and the Time Trial confirm (`select_pressed`) are L2. Refusing the press before the game's handler runs leaves no state behind.
- **Time Trial:** record tracks have `time_trial` false unless their record sets it. Tracks made for 1.5 run Time Trial unless their facts say `time_trial: false` (`time_trial_why`: none of their files holds a world the track layers load).
- **Stat ids:** the game stores each track record at its stat id and tolerates holes, so a record track's id from 254 down is safe there. Weekends and track data records hold stat ids as one byte, with 0xff for none.
- **Stock slots without assets:** `paul_ricard`, `portimao`, `sochi`, `hanoi`, `texas_nat`, `suzuka_east`, `bahrain_pad`, `silverstone_int`. `bahrain24` is empty.
- **Stack-built keys:** a new track must carry `CareerHubFirstVisit_N`, `CareerHubLastVisit_N`, `TrackHighlights_N` and `TrackVideo_N` (`tools/track_keys.py`).
- **Track data is found by mode mask,** and sub-tables inherit from the parent set one table at a time. A session's query names the setup mode and the box's season; with no season, the first set listing the mode wins.
- **AI packs** are per car folder (`ai_package_folder/asset_filename`). A car package with its own AI data, such as F1 1990's `f1_1990`, has an `ai_track_difficulties.<package folder>` key only on the tracks it was made for. A missing key reads the miss sentinel, not null.
- **Worlds:** `_f1_26` worlds have 22 grid slots and 11 garages, `_myteam` 24 and 12, and `_f1` 10 garages. An 11-team box crashed on `_f1` worlds in `Sess_Assign_GarageSlotsByPreference`. Classic Seasons fixed it with a layer copy of `f1_26` for `swofty_f1`.
- **Garage order:** `Sess_Assign_GarageSlotsByTeamOrder` gives the team at position i of the team order garage i with no bound check, so a team past the world's garage count reads past the garage vector. F1 2012 Season (12 teams) at Mugello, which has no `2012` world, crashed there. The world and garages rules stop it at the track select; a session that reaches the assignment some other way is not guarded.
- **A world the track doesn't hold:** the game still loads the session. What it puts in the missing world's place is not reverse engineered. The world rule leaves such a track out. A world no track holds in the facts has no facts and passes.
- **Grid slots per track** differ. Custom Grid Size's table gives Imola, Singapore and Abu Dhabi 26, and Monaco 28.
- **Unknown:** the invitational slot limit (8 tracks without the loader), Time Trial on added tracks (crashes or freezes), and the 28-car session-enter crash on community maps.
- **Size:** a track adds about 1,650 to 1,884 records and changes about 470 to 490. Autopolis alone sets 400.
