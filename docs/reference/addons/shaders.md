# Shader configs and effects

Two things make the picture look different in 1.8:

- An **effect** is HLSL with a declared list of options. The launcher ships a [library of effects](./shader-effects), and an addon can add its own.
- A **config** is a `.swfx` text file that lists effect instances in order and sets their options. Players pick one on the [Shaders page](/using/shaders).

An addon bundles configs, effects or both.

## A config in full

```toml [realistic.swfx]
# Comments start with #.
name = "Realistic"                       # required
author = "Swofty"
description = "Flatter contrast, calmer reds and HDR-like highlights."
swfx = 1                                 # the format version; optional, only 1 exists

# Each [table] is an effect instance. They run in file order.
[auto_hdr]
shadow_tuning = 1.94                     # float: a number; an integer is fine
highlight_saturation = 1.5
auto_hdr_method = "highlights"           # enum: one of the effect's values
hdr_tonemap = true                       # bool

[ambient_light]
al_int = 0.96
al_lens = true
al_lens_int = 10

[color_mod]
chroma = 0.917
brightness = [-0.039, -0.033, -0.033]    # color3: r, g, b

# Switch an instance off without deleting it.
[perspective]
enabled = false
fov_angle = 120

# A second instance of the same effect takes a label.
[glare]
bloom = 35

[glare.wide]
bloom = 10
threshold = 60
```

Anything a table leaves out takes the effect's default. The [effect library](./shader-effects) lists every effect with its options and defaults.

## What the checker enforces

The launcher checks a config on every change in the editor, in `swofty shaders lint`, and when the profile builds. A config with an error is not applied; the last valid version stays live. Each message below is the checker's own wording.

Top-level keys:

```toml
name = "Mine"        # required: A config needs a `name = "..."` (quick fix: Add a name); an empty name is `name` must not be empty
author = "Me"        # a string
description = "..."  # a string
swfx = 1             # must be 1: `swfx` must be 1, the only config format version
colour = "x"         # warning: Unknown top-level key `colour`; it is ignored
```

Tables:

```toml
[grane]              # error: Unknown effect `grane`; if it comes from an addon, that addon is not installed
                     #        quick fix: Change to `grain`
[vignette]
amoutn = 0.4         # error: `vignette` has no param `amoutn`        (quick fix: Change to `amount`)
amount = "high"      # error: `amount` expects a number, not a string
radius = 9           # warning: `radius` is above its maximum of 1.5; it is clamped to 1.5
                     #          quick fix: Clamp to 1.5
enabled = 1          # error: `enabled` expects true or false, not a whole number

[vignette]           # error: `[vignette]` appears twice; give the second a label, like `[vignette.second]`
```

Value types follow the option's type:

```toml
al_int = 0.96                    # float: a number
al_adapt_base_black_lvl = 2      # int: a whole number
al_lens = true                   # bool
al_dirt_tex = "smudges"          # enum: a string; error: "smudge" is not a value of `al_dirt_tex`; use one of "smudges", "specks"
brightness = [0, 0, 0]           # float2, color3 and color4: an array of 2, 3 or 4 numbers
                                 # error: `brightness` expects 3 numbers, not 2
```

- A value outside the option's `min` and `max` is a warning, and the value is clamped.
- A label cannot repeat one of the effect's option names: `The label `bloom` is also a param of `glare``.
- A config with no enabled instance gets the info `This config changes nothing`.
- An effect from an addon that is not installed is the unknown-effect error. When two addons declare the same effect id, or an addon declares a library id, the first in load order wins and the other effect is ignored with a warning in the build output. Load order is the profile's addon order, then the remaining addons by id.

## Bundle a config in an addon

```json [swofty.json]
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "id": "swofty.realistic-shader",
  "name": "Realistic Shader",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Swofty",
  "category": "shaders",
  "compat": { "game": "f1_25", "launcher": ">=1.8.0" },
  "shaders": [
    { "config": "shaders/realistic.swfx" },
    { "config": "shaders/realistic-hdr.swfx", "force": false }
  ]
}
```

```text
swofty.realistic-shader/
  swofty.json
  shaders/realistic.swfx
  shaders/realistic-hdr.swfx
```

- `shaders` is a list of entries; `config` is a relative `.swfx` path inside the addon. Its file name without `.swfx` is the config's id: `addon:swofty.realistic-shader/realistic`. Two entries with the same file name are refused.
- `effects` is a list of relative `<id>.effect.json` paths inside the addon.
- The configs show on the Shaders page under **From addons** with the addon's name, read-only. A player can copy one to personal.
- The configs stay available while the addon is switched off. Deleting the addon removes them, and every profile that had one of them active goes back to no config.
- Set `compat.launcher` to `>=1.8.0`: an older launcher refuses the addon at install with `needs Swofty Launcher >=1.8.0`.
- An addon never turns its own config on. The player picks it.

### Forcing a config

```json [swofty.json]
"shaders": [
  { "config": "shaders/broadcast.swfx", "force": true }
]
```

While the addon is switched on, `force: true` makes that config the active one, locks the Shaders page and shows the banner "You have an addon which forces this shader configuration", with a **View addon** button. Use it for an addon whose other content only looks right with that config.

An addon may force one config; the manifest is refused with `only one config may be forced` otherwise. When several enabled addons force a config, the last one in load order wins, as later addons override earlier ones everywhere else in the launcher. A shader-only addon has no switch and counts as on whenever it is installed.

### Shader-only addons

An addon whose content is only `shaders` and `effects`, plus metadata, an icon and a category, is a shader-only addon. Any `options`, `operations`, `launcher`, `hud`, `hub_tab`, `career_setup`, `multiplayer`, `shader` or `postfx` entry makes it a mixed addon. It has no on/off switch on the **Addons** page, and shows a **Shader config** chip with **Open in Shaders**. `swofty addons list` shows it as `shaders`. An addon that has other content keeps its switch, and says under it "Its shader config stays in Shaders while it's off".

## An effect in full

An effect is a JSON file named `<id>.effect.json` beside its HLSL. This one tints the picture and adds an optional darkening towards a corner.

```json [effects/warm_tint.effect.json]
{
  "id": "warm_tint",
  "name": "Warm Tint",
  "description": "Pulls the picture towards a colour, optionally darker towards the bottom.",
  "params": [
    { "id": "amount", "type": "float", "default": 0.3, "min": 0, "max": 1, "step": 0.01,
      "label": "Amount", "doc": "How far the picture moves towards the tint colour." },
    { "id": "tint", "type": "color3", "default": [1.0, 0.85, 0.7], "min": 0, "max": 2,
      "label": "Tint", "doc": "The colour in linear light." },
    { "id": "mode", "type": "enum", "values": ["multiply", "add"], "default": "multiply",
      "label": "Mode", "doc": "Multiply darkens, add lifts." },
    { "id": "fade_bottom", "type": "bool", "default": false,
      "label": "Fade bottom", "doc": "Darkens the lower third." }
  ],
  "textures": [],
  "passes": [
    { "name": "apply", "shader": "warm_tint.hlsl", "entry": "apply" }
  ]
}
```

```hlsl [effects/warm_tint.hlsl]
#include "swofty/params.hlsli"

float4 apply(float2 uv, uint2 pixel)
{
    float4 c = scene_at(int2(pixel));
    float3 rgb = to_linear(c.rgb);
    float3 tinted = param_mode() == MODE_ADD ? rgb + param_tint() * 0.1 : rgb * param_tint();
    rgb = lerp(rgb, tinted, param_amount());
    if (param_fade_bottom())
        rgb *= 1 - 0.4 * smoothstep(0.66, 1.0, uv.y);
    return float4(from_linear(rgb), c.a);
}
```

Register it in the manifest. A config in the same addon, or any other addon, can use it:

```json [swofty.json]
"effects": ["effects/warm_tint.effect.json"],
"shaders": [{ "config": "shaders/warm.swfx" }]
```

```toml [shaders/warm.swfx]
name = "Warm"

[warm_tint]
amount = 0.4
tint = [1.0, 0.8, 0.6]
mode = "add"
```

An effect id is `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*` and unique. The library owns the unprefixed names, so name yours with something of your own.

## Params

```json
{ "id": "amount",  "type": "float",  "default": 0.3, "min": 0, "max": 1, "step": 0.01, "label": "Amount", "doc": "..." }
{ "id": "levels",  "type": "int",    "default": 4, "min": 1, "max": 8, "label": "Levels", "doc": "..." }
{ "id": "smooth",  "type": "bool",   "default": true, "label": "Smooth", "doc": "..." }
{ "id": "mode",    "type": "enum",   "values": ["off", "low", "high"], "default": "low", "label": "Mode", "doc": "..." }
{ "id": "offset",  "type": "float2", "default": [0, 0], "min": -1, "max": 1, "label": "Offset", "doc": "..." }
{ "id": "tint",    "type": "color3", "default": [1, 1, 1], "min": 0, "max": 2, "label": "Tint", "doc": "..." }
{ "id": "border",  "type": "color4", "default": [0, 0, 0, 1], "min": 0, "max": 1, "label": "Border", "doc": "..." }
```

- `id` is `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*` and unique in the effect. `label` and `doc` are what the editor shows on hover.
- `min` and `max` apply to every number of a vector. `step` is the editor's nudge size. A `default` outside `min` and `max` is refused.
- An int's `default`, `min` and `max` are whole numbers.
- An enum needs at least one value, and its default is one of them.

### Slots

An effect's params pack into 32 float slots, in declaration order. `float`, `int`, `bool` and `enum` take one slot, `float2` two, `color3` three and `color4` four. An effect that needs more than 32 is refused: ``effect `x` needs 33 param slots; the limit is 32``.

```text
amount    float   slot 0
levels    int     slot 1
mode      enum    slot 2
offset    float2  slots 3-4
tint      color3  slots 5-7
border    color4  slots 8-11        12 of 32 used
```

A pass reads slot `n` with `option(n)`. `option(0)` to `option(15)` come from the original options, and `option(16)` to `option(31)` from the four extra `float4`s that follow them in the constant buffer.

### The generated accessors

Before it compiles an effect, the build writes `swofty/params.hlsli` on the include path. For the params above it holds

```hlsl
#pragma once
#include "swofty/postfx.hlsli"

float param_amount() { return option(0); }
int param_levels() { return int(round(option(1))); }
uint param_mode() { return uint(round(option(2))); }
#define MODE_OFF 0
#define MODE_LOW 1
#define MODE_HIGH 2
float2 param_offset() { return float2(option(3), option(4)); }
float3 param_tint() { return float3(option(5), option(6), option(7)); }
float4 param_border() { return float4(option(8), option(9), option(10), option(11)); }
```

- Effect HLSL does `#include "swofty/params.hlsli"`. It pulls in `swofty/postfx.hlsli`.
- A bool accessor is `bool param_<id>() { return option(n) > 0.5; }`.
- An enum constant is `<ID>_<VALUE>` upper-cased with every other character as `_`: the value `"two-way"` of `mode` is `MODE_TWO_WAY`. Two constants with the same name are refused.

## Textures and passes

An effect's `textures` and `passes` are the [post-process passes](./postfx) contract with names local to the effect. Two instances of the same effect, such as `[glare]` and `[glare.wide]`, each get their own textures.

```json
"textures": [
  { "name": "half", "scale": 0.5, "format": "rgba16f" },
  { "name": "adapt", "width": 1, "height": 1, "format": "rgba16f", "persistent": true },
  { "name": "dirt", "file": "ambient_light_dirt.png" }
],
"passes": [
  { "name": "bright", "shader": "ambient_light.hlsl", "entry": "bright", "output": "half" },
  { "name": "down",   "shader": "ambient_light.hlsl", "entry": "down", "inputs": ["half"], "output": "half2" },
  { "name": "apply",  "shader": "ambient_light.hlsl", "entry": "apply", "inputs": ["half", "adapt", "dirt"] }
]
```

- A pass has `name`, `shader`, `entry`, `raw`, `threads`, `inputs`, `output`, `when` and `budget_ms`, as in [post-process passes](./postfx#passes).
- `inputs` names the effect's textures, and also `original` (the picture before any pass this frame) and `previous` (the last frame's picture after every pass). Read them with `input(i, uv)` by their place in the list.
- No `output` writes the picture. A pass that writes a texture is sized by it.
- A `persistent` texture keeps its contents from frame to frame. The ambient light effect stores its eye adaptation in one.
- A `file` texture is an image from the effect's folder, read-only.
- A texture with `mips` carries a mip chain, described below.
- The pass order is the order in the file. Passes of the next instance start where this one ends.
- A pass that reads `previous` sees the picture after all the instances, so it lags one frame behind.

### Mipmapped textures

`mips` is the number of levels of a texture, including the full-size one: 1 (the default) up to 12, and no more than floor(log2(max(width, height))) + 1.

```json
"textures": [
  { "name": "lens", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "format": "rgba16f", "mips": 5 },
  { "name": "stats", "width": 64, "height": 32, "format": "rg16f", "mips": 7 }
]
```

- `mips` works with every `format`, with `scale`, `width` and `height`, and with `persistent`. A `file` texture takes no mips. A `mips` above what the size allows is lowered to it, with a warning.
- A pass writes level 0 only. After every pass that writes the texture, the core rebuilds levels 1 and up, each the 2x2 average of the level above (an odd size rounds down, at least 1x1).
- A pass that reads the texture sees the chain as of the last write.
- `input(i, uv)` reads level 0. These read any level:

```hlsl
float4 input_lod(uint i, float2 uv, float lod);        // linear within and between levels, clamped to the edge
float4 input_lod_point(uint i, float2 uv, float lod);  // the nearest texel of the nearest level
uint2  input_size_lod(uint i, uint lod);               // the size of a level
```

## Rules

A config can change its own options while something happens in the game, such as a car on a kerb, a hit or a yellow flag. Each `[[when]]` block names a signal and the values to use while it is on. The core fades from the config's own values to the rule's values and back.

```toml [vhs.swfx]
name = "1980s - VHS Off-Air Recording"
author = "Jonno"

[rewind_video]
tvl = 240
noise = 0.04
detail = 0.3
smear = 0.25
saturation = 1.0

# The tape loses tracking while two wheels are on a kerb.
[[when]]
name = "kerb tracking"
on = "car.surface"
is = "kerb"
wheels = 2
min_ms = 40
hold_ms = 120
fade_in_ms = 60
fade_out_ms = 350
[when.set.rewind_video]
noise = 0.12
detail = 0.15
smear = 0.6

# The signal breaks up on a hard hit.
[[when]]
name = "impact dropout"
on = "car.impact"
above = 3.0
for_ms = 500
fade_in_ms = 0
fade_out_ms = 500
priority = 20
[when.set.rewind_video]
noise = 0.35
saturation = 0.4

# Smear scales with speed: nothing at 250 km/h or below, full at 320 km/h or above.
[[when]]
name = "flat out"
on = "car.speed"
from = 250
to = 320
[when.set.rewind_video]
smear = 0.5
```

The Rewind effect is `rewind_video`; see the [effect library](./shader-effects). A rule only moves options the config's effects already have.

### A rule in full

```toml
[[when]]
name = "..."              # optional; shown in the editor, the Preview and the log
on = "<signal>"           # required unless `all` is given

is = "kerb"               # a value of a name signal, or a list: is = ["grass", "gravel"]
wheels = 2                # 1-4, car.surface only; default 1
above = 3.0               # a number signal, or the magnitude of an event
below = 50.0
from = 250                # a ramp; needs `to`, from < to, number signals only
to = 320
all = [                   # every entry must hold
  { on = "car.surface", is = "kerb" },
  { on = "car.speed", above = 150 },
]

min_ms = 0                # the condition must hold this long before the rule turns on
hold_ms = 0               # the rule stays on this long after the condition clears
for_ms = 400              # event rules only
fade_in_ms = 150
fade_out_ms = 300

priority = 0              # integer -100 to 100

[when.set.rewind_video]   # also [when.set.<effect>.<label>]
noise = 0.12              # any option of that instance
enabled = false           # turns the instance off while the rule is on
```

`[when.set.<effect>]` and `[when.set.<effect>.<label>]` belong to the most recent `[[when]]`. `when` is reserved: no effect can be named `when`, and `[when]` with single brackets is an error with the quick fix `[[when]]`. An array may span several lines, with comments at line ends.

### Conditions

A rule has one kind of condition. Each block below is a separate rule's keys:

```toml
on = "view.replay"                 # none: a yes/no signal is on while it is true

on = "race.start"                  # none: an event turns the rule on for `for_ms`

on = "car.surface"
is = "kerb"                        # is: a name signal equals this value
is = ["grass", "gravel"]           # is: equals any of these
wheels = 2                         # at least 2 of the 4 wheels on those surfaces

on = "car.speed"
above = 150                        # above: on above this value

on = "car.speed"
below = 50                         # below: on below this value

on = "car.speed"
above = 100
below = 200                        # both: on between the two values

on = "car.speed"
from = 250
to = 320                           # from + to: strength 0 at 250, 1 at 320, no fade

all = [{ on = "car.surface", is = "kerb" }, { on = "car.speed", above = 150 }]
```

- `above` and `below` on an event test the event's magnitude: `car.impact` is in g, `car.damage` is 0 to 1.
- `from` and `to` take number signals, only at the top level, and not together with `all`.
- `all` entries use `on` with one of `is`, `above`, `below`, and `wheels`. An event signal is only ever a rule's top-level `on`.

### Timing

All values are milliseconds, 0 to 60000.

```toml
min_ms = 0         # default 0: the condition must hold this long before the rule turns on
hold_ms = 0        # default 0: the rule stays on this long after the condition clears
for_ms = 400       # default 400: how long one event keeps the rule on; a new event restarts it
fade_in_ms = 150   # default 150: 0 to full strength
fade_out_ms = 300  # default 300: full strength to 0
```

A fade of 0 jumps. A ramp rule takes its strength from the signal: its fades default to 0, and a fade set on it smooths a signal that jumps. `min_ms`, `hold_ms` and `for_ms` don't apply to a ramp.

### Priority and overrides

```toml
[[when]]
on = "car.impact"
above = 3.0
priority = 20                # beats a priority 0 rule on the same option
[when.set.rewind_video]
noise = 0.35
saturation = 0.4

[[when]]
on = "session.flag"
is = "yellow"
[when.set.bloom.wide]        # the instance bloom.wide
enabled = false              # only false is allowed
```

`enabled = false` turns the instance off while the rule is on. A rule cannot turn an instance on, and cannot name an instance that is off in the config. Options take the same types and clamping as the instance tables.

### How values blend

```text
numbers, vectors, colours   move from the config's value to the rule's value per component, on a smoothstep curve
integers                    blend, then round
yes/no, choice, enabled     switch when the rule is halfway in
several rules, one option   applied in priority order, each blending over the result so far
```

- The highest priority ends on top. Equal priorities apply in file order, so the later rule wins.
- Rules that set different options do not affect each other.
- A smooth on and off for a yes/no option needs an effect with a strength option.
- A ramp rule sets its strength straight from the signal.

### Signals

Every signal is for the player's car. The `car.*` signals read the player's own car, also in replays and while spectating. The `car.*` signals and `session.wetness` are read from the Steam copy of F1 25; on the EA app copy they have no value yet.

```text
in game now
view.replay         yes/no
view.paused         yes/no
view.photo          yes/no
view.menu           yes/no   in the menus and on loading screens: no session is running
view.cutscene       yes/no
view.spectating     yes/no
session.start       event    the session loads
race.start          event    lights out
session.lap         event    the player completes a lap
session.end         event    the session ends
car.speed           number   km/h, 0-400
car.rpm             number   0-1 of the limiter
car.gear            number   -1 reverse, 0 neutral, 1-8
car.throttle        number   0-1
car.brake           number   0-1
car.steer           number   -1 to 1
car.g_lateral       number   g, -6 to 6
car.g_long          number   g, -6 to 6, braking negative
car.surface         name     tarmac kerb rumble grass gravel sand, per wheel
car.wetness         number   0-1 water under the car's wheels: the wettest of the four

`car.surface` groups the game's surfaces: `kerb` is its rumble strips, `rumble` its ridged strips, `gravel` takes gravel, rock and mud, `tarmac` takes tarmac, concrete, cobbles, metal and standing water, and `grass` and `sand` are themselves. A wheel in the air has no surface.

A signal the game does not read, or one with no live session, has no value: its conditions are false and its events never occur.

### Only on track

A config that should leave the menus and loading screens alone turns each of its instances off while `view.menu` is on:

```toml
[[when]]
name = "menus"
on = "view.menu"
fade_in_ms = 0
fade_out_ms = 0
[when.set.rewind_video]
enabled = false
[when.set.rewind_cadence]
enabled = false
```

### Limits

- At most 16 rules per config and 32 overrides per rule.
- A rule changes options and turns instances off. It cannot add effects, change passes or swap to another config.
- An instance a rule turns off keeps its persistent textures, and `previous` keeps flowing.
- A rule cannot override another rule.
- A change to the config resets every rule to off.

### Rule checks

The checker marks these as you type, with quick fixes where a name is close:

```text
unknown signal `car.surfce`; did you mean `car.surface`?
`is` needs a value of car.surface: tarmac, kerb, rumble, grass, gravel, sand
`above` needs a number signal; car.surface is a name
`for_ms` is for events; car.speed is a number
`from` must be below `to`
[when.set.bloom] names no instance of this config
[when.set.x] names an instance that's off in this config
rewind_video has no option `noiz`; did you mean `noise`?
`saturation` is 3.0, outside 0.0-2.0 for rewind_video; it is clamped
car.impact isn't read in game yet; this rule only fires in the Preview     (warning)
```

### Rule log lines

```text
[shaders] rule "kerb tracking" on (car.surface = kerb, 2 wheels)
[shaders] rule "kerb tracking" off after 1.4 s
[shaders] rule "flat out" on (car.speed = 287 km/h)
[shaders] rule "impact dropout": car.impact isn't read in game yet; it never fires
[shaders] rule "kerb tracking": 37 time(s) on in the last 60 s
```

Every on and off is logged for the first 60 seconds after a config loads. After that, one line per minute gives the count for each rule that turned on. The "isn't read in game yet" line is logged once per rule per config load.

## The `swofty shaders` command

```sh
swofty shaders list                          # every config: ref, name, source; marks the active (or forced) one
swofty shaders effects                       # every effect available
swofty shaders effects ambient_light         # one effect with its params, slots and defaults
swofty shaders show personal:night-race      # a config's text; a config's name works in place of a ref
swofty shaders lint my-look.swfx             # check a file or a ref; exits non-zero on an error
swofty shaders use addon:swofty.realistic-shader/realistic
swofty shaders use off
swofty shaders new "Night race"              # from the starter template
swofty shaders copy addon:swofty.realistic-shader/realistic
swofty shaders rename personal:night-race "Night race 2"
swofty shaders delete personal:night-race
swofty shaders import my-look.swfx
swofty shaders export personal:night-race night-race.swfx
swofty shaders key F9                        # the in-game on/off key: A-Z, 0-9, F1-F24 or "None"
swofty shaders key                           # print the key
```

A ref is `personal:<slug>` for a file in the launcher's `shaders/` folder, or `addon:<addon id>/<file name without .swfx>`.

`swofty shaders lint` prints each diagnostic as `file:line:column: severity: message`, followed by a `fix:` line when there is a quick fix, and exits 1 when the config has an error. `swofty shaders use` also says when an addon forces a config over the one you chose.

## What the game logs

The core logs each time the active config changes. `serial` counts the changes:

```text
[shaders] config "Realistic" (serial 42): 5 effect(s), 11 pass(es)
[shaders] config "Realistic" (serial 43): 4 effect(s), 9 pass(es)
```

A parameter-only change updates the values and logs the new serial. The per-pass GPU time lines name the effect and its instance, like `ambient_light` or `glare.wide`. A pass whose average GPU time stays over its `budget_ms` is turned off, as in [post-process passes](./postfx#in-game).

A plain `postfx` pass in an addon's manifest still runs, after the config's effects.
